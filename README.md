# Advanced Numbers Program in My Project

## Overview

In this project, numbers play a crucial role, serving as fundamental elements for a wide array of scenarios and addressing various numerical questions.

## Number Operations

We perform a variety of number-related operations to handle different use cases within the project, including:

- **Strong Number Check:**
  - A strong number is a number whose sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the original number. For example, let's take the number 145:
  - 1!+4!+5!=1+24+120=145
  - So, 145 is a strong number.
    
- **Automorphic Number Check:**
  - Verifying automorphic numbers, which remain unchanged when their square is found. For example, 5 is an automorphic number as 5^2 = 25, and 25 ends with 5.

- **friendly pair Number Check:**
  - wo numbers are considered a friendly pair if the sum of the proper divisors of each number is equal to the other number. For example, (220, 284) is a friendly pair
  - because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284,
  - and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.
  - These checks involve specific mathematical calculations and comparisons based on the properties of numbers.
  - If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any of these types of numbers, feel free to ask!

- **Additional Number Operations:**
  - Any other relevant number-related operations or questions specific to our project.

All the number-related questions and operations are documented in the project, providing detailed information for each operation. Refer to the corresponding documentation or instructions for a comprehensive understanding of each numerical concept.
